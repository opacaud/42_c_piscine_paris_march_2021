# 42_c_piscine_paris_march_2021

My work for 42 Paris' C piscine in March 2021.
All of it following the norm of 42 school which PDF you can find here as well.

## The two first modules are focused on Shell

## The next ones, on C

Mostly recreating functions that already exist. With only the basic write function and the ones we wrote as we go.

Module | Content
------ | -------
C00 | Basics like putchar, putnbr
C01 | Pointers, strings and other arrays like swap, putstr, strlen, sort_tab
C02 | Manipulate and get info on strings like strcpy, is_alpha, strupcase
C03 | Get info on strings like strcmp, strcat, strstr
C04 | Mixing letters and numbers like atoi, putnbr_base, atoi_base
C05 | Some math like iterative and recursive factorial, power, fibonacci, sqrt
C06 | Handling parameters like print_params, sort_params
C07 | Malloc, pointers and strings like strdup, strjoin, convert_base, split
C08 | Header files and structures
C09 | Librairies, Makefile and split (again)

## Rush

The goal was to print rectangles which width and height are defined through the parameters to the rush functions in the main.c files.

There were 5 different subjects but the only difference really was the characters used to print said rectangle.

## Study session for the final exam

There are a few exercises that could be asked during the final piscine exam.
